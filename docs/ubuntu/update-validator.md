# Update already installed delta testnet validator node on Ubuntu 20.04

> **Note**  
> Do not execute all the commands below as root. sudo is included where it is required. 

## Set version you're going to set up

Set a variable defining the version of the node package you're setting up. For `1.0.0`, use `1_0_0`

```CASPER_VERSION=1_0_0```

## Update software

### Stop the node if it is running and remove old packages and configuration

```
sudo systemctl stop casper-node
sudo systemctl stop casper-node-launcher

cd ~
sudo apt remove -y casper-node 
sudo apt remove -y casper-client 
sudo apt remove -y casper-node-launcher

# Clean up old genesis file location
sudo rm /etc/casper/config.*
sudo rm /etc/casper/accounts.csv 
sudo rm /etc/casper/chainspec.toml 
sudo rm /etc/casper/validation.md5
```

### Download and install new node software

```
curl -JLO https://bintray.com/casperlabs/debian/download_file?file_path=casper-node-launcher_0.2.0-0_amd64.deb
curl -JLO https://bintray.com/casperlabs/debian/download_file?file_path=casper-client_0.7.6-0_amd64.deb
sudo apt install -y ./casper-client_0.7.6-0_amd64.deb ./casper-node-launcher_0.2.0-0_amd64.deb
```

## Configure and Run the Node

### Set up configuration

```
cd /etc/casper
sudo -u casper ./pull_casper_node_version.sh $CASPER_VERSION
```

### Get known validator IP

Let's get a known validator IP first. We'll use it multiple times later in the process.

```
KNOWN_ADDRESSES=$(cat /etc/casper/$CASPER_VERSION/config.toml | grep known_addresses)
KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IPS=$(grep -oE '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' <<< "$KNOWN_ADDRESSES")
IFS=' ' read -r KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP _REST <<< "$KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IPS"

echo $KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP
```

After running the commands above the ```$KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP``` variable will contain IP address of a known validator.

### Set trusted hash

Get the trusted hash from the network:

```
# Get trusted_hash into config.toml
sudo sed -i "/trusted_hash =/c\trusted_hash = '$(curl -s $KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP:8888/status | jq -r .last_added_block_info.hash | tr -d '\n')'" /etc/casper/$CASPER_VERSION/config.toml
```

### Start the node

```
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/casper-node
sudo /etc/casper/delete_local_db.sh; sleep 1
sudo systemctl start casper-node-launcher
systemctl status casper-node-launcher
```

### Monitor the node status

#### Check the node log

```
sudo tail -fn100 /var/log/casper/casper-node.log /var/log/casper/casper-node.stderr.log
```

#### Check if a known validator sees your node among peers

```
curl -s http://$KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP:8888/status | jq .peers
```

You should see your IP address on the list

#### Check the node status

```
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/status
```

#### Wait for node to catch up
Before you do anything, such as trying to bond as a validator or perform any RPC calls, make sure your node has fully 
caught up with the network. You can recognize this by log entries that tell you that joining has finished, and that the
RPC and REST servers have started:

```
{"timestamp":"Feb 09 02:28:35.577","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"finished joining"},"target":"casper_node::cli"}
{"timestamp":"Feb 09 02:28:35.578","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"started JSON-RPC server","address":"0.0.0.0:7777"},"target":"casper_node::components::rpc_server::http_server"}
{"timestamp":"Feb 09 02:28:35.578","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"started REST server","address":"0.0.0.0:8888"},"target":"casper_node::components::rest_server::http_server"}
```

## Re-build smart contracts that are required to bond to the network 

### Build smart contracts

#### Get casper-node
If you don't have it yet, clone casper-node:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/CasperLabs/casper-node.git
```

#### Go to the directory with casper-node sources

```
cd ~/casper-node
```

#### Pull the latest changes

```
git fetch
```

#### Checkout the release branch

```
git checkout release-0.7.6
```

#### Remove previous builds

```
make clean
```

#### Build the contracts

```
make setup-rs && make build-client-contracts -j
```

## Fund your account

To fund an account visit the [Faucet](https://clarity.casperlabs.io/#/faucet) page. Select the account you want to fund and hit "Request Tokens". Wait until the request transaction succeeds.

## Bond to the network

Once you ensure that your node is running correctly and is visible by other proceed to bonding.

### Check your balance

Check your balance to ensure you have funds to bond:

To get the balance we need to perform the following three query commands:

1. Get the state root hash (has to be performed for each balance check because the hash changes with time): 

    ```
    casper-client get-state-root-hash --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 | jq -r
    ```
2. Get the main purse associated with your account:

    ```
    casper-client query-state --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 --key <PUBLIC_KEY_HEX> --state-root-hash <STATE_ROOT_HASH> | jq -r
    ```

3. Get the main purse balance:

    ```
    casper-client get-balance --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 --purse-uref <PURSE_UREF> --state-root-hash <STATE_ROOT_HASH> | jq -r
    ```

If you followed the installation steps from this document you can run the following script to check the balance:

```
PUBLIC_KEY_HEX=$(cat /etc/casper/validator_keys/public_key_hex)
STATE_ROOT_HASH=$(casper-client get-state-root-hash --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 | jq -r '.result | .state_root_hash')
PURSE_UREF=$(casper-client query-state --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 --key "$PUBLIC_KEY_HEX" --state-root-hash "$STATE_ROOT_HASH" | jq -r '.result | .stored_value | .Account | .main_purse')
casper-client get-balance --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 --purse-uref "$PURSE_UREF" --state-root-hash "$STATE_ROOT_HASH" | jq -r '.result | .balance_value'
```

### Make bonding request

To bond to the network as a validator you need to submit your bid using ```casper-client```:

```
casper-client put-deploy \
        --chain-name "<CHAIN_NAME>" \
        --node-address "http://127.0.0.1:7777/" \
        --secret-key "/etc/casper/validator_keys/secret_key.pem" \
        --session-path "$HOME/casper-node/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/add_bid.wasm" \
        --payment-amount 1000000000 \
        --gas-price=1 \
        --session-arg=public_key:"public_key='<PUBLIC_KEY_HEX>'" \
        --session-arg=amount:"u512='9000000000000000'" \
        --session-arg=delegation_rate:"u64='10'"
```

Where:
- ```amount``` - This is the amount that is being bid. If the bid wins, this will be the validator’s initial bond amount. Recommended bid in amount is 90% of your faucet balance.  This is 900,000 CSPR  or 9000000000000000 motes as an argument to the add_bid contract deploy. 
- ```delegation_rate``` - The percentage of rewards that the validator retains from delegators that delegate their tokens to the node.

Replace:
- ```<CHAIN_NAME>``` with the chain name you are joining
- ```<PUBLIC_KEY_HEX>``` with the hex representation of you public key 

Remember the ```deploy_hash``` returned in the response to query its status later.

If you followed the installation steps from this document you can run the following script to bond. It substitutes the public key hex value for you and sends recommended argument values:

```
PUBLIC_KEY_HEX=$(cat /etc/casper/validator_keys/public_key_hex)
CHAIN_NAME=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/status | jq -r '.chainspec_name')

casper-client put-deploy \
    --chain-name "$CHAIN_NAME" \
    --node-address "http://127.0.0.1:7777/" \
    --secret-key "/etc/casper/validator_keys/secret_key.pem" \
    --session-path "$HOME/casper-node/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/add_bid.wasm" \
    --payment-amount 1000000000 \
    --gas-price=1 \
    --session-arg=public_key:"public_key='$PUBLIC_KEY_HEX'" \
    --session-arg=amount:"u512='9000000000000000'" \
    --session-arg=delegation_rate:"u64='10'"
```

### Check that you bonding request worked

Sending a transaction to the network does not mean that the transaction processed successfully. It’s important to check to see that the contract executed properly:

```
casper-client get-deploy --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 <DEPLOY_HASH> | jq .result.execution_results
```

Replace ```<DEPLOY_HASH>``` with the deploy hash of the transaction you want to check.

### Query the auction info and look for your bid

To determine if the bid was accepted, execute the following command:

```
casper-client get-auction-info --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777
```

The bid should appear among the returned ```bids```. If the public key associated with a bid appears in the ```validator_weights``` structure for an era, then the account is bonded in that era.
